# Web panel server management
This is an administration panel for managing the Minecarft server via the website for my client.
The admin panel is designed for administrators the network of Playtale.pl. 
The goal of project is to operate servers easily and quickly in one place, without entering unnecessary commands in Linux.



# Functions
The application communicates with a virtual linux server and with the Minecraft game server. 
This allows you to turn on/of the game server, connect to the server console and call the commands that facilitate the management of the server.
The application is ready to use and has been tested by the customer.

#### Main functions of my application:
 - checking server status(number of active players, etc.),
 - the user is able to turn on/off the server,
 - live server console for administrators,

[mcfuc](https://github.com/xNykram/flask_project/blob/master/mcfuc.py) is a module created by me. That allows me to quickly manage the Minecraft server

# Things to improve
I still have a lot of changes to make in this application, because it contains a lot of errors in the code and some in operation.
