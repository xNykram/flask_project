# Web panel server management
>This is an administration panel for managing the Minecarft server via the website for my client.
The admin panel is designed for administrators the network of Playtale.pl. 
The goal of project is to operate servers easily and quickly in one place, without entering unnecessary commands in Linux.

# Functions
>The application communicates with a virtual linux server and with the Minecraft game server. 
This allows you to turn on/of the game server, connect to the server console and call the commands that facilitate the management of the server.
The application is ready to use and has been tested by the customer. The client also asked for the application to be implemented on its dedicated server. This was also realized within the project.

#### Main functions of my application:
 - checking server status(number of active players, etc.),
 - the user is able to turn on/off the server,
 - live server console for administrators,
 - the application connects to the database,
 - virtual server control

[mcfuc](https://github.com/xNykram/flask_project/tree/master/venv/mcfuc.py) is a module created by me. That allows me to quickly manage the Minecraft server

# Things to improve
>The client confirms that the application is working on his machine, but I still have a lot of changes to make in this application, because it contains a lot of errors in the code.
